    title: "Multithreaded News System",
    description:
      "The purpose of this project is to gain experience with concurrent programming and synchronization mechanisms. The scenario simulates a news broadcasting system, where different types of stories are produced, sorted, and displayed to the public. The assignment involves four types of active actors: Producers, Dispatcher, Co-Editors, and Screen Manager. The Producers generate strings representing news stories and send them to the Dispatcher. The Dispatcher sorts the stories based on their type and sends them to the corresponding Co-Editors. The Co-Editors edit the stories and pass them to the Screen Manager. Finally, the Screen Manager displays the stories on the screen. Each of them works in a different thread, allowing the system to work simultaneously. The system includes a bounded buffer, which is used as a queue between the Producers and the Dispatcher, as well as between the Co-Editors and the Screen Manager. This desgind needs to face the Producerâ€“consumer problem. The Dispatcher's queues are unbounded buffers.",

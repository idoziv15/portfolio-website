  description: `Hey! üëãüèæ My name is Nate, welcome to my digital space. I'm a software engineer. I work with companies to deliver software solutions with an emphasis on frontend web development, design systems and accessibility. Currently, I work as a software engineer at Coforma improving digital processes for Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. I've previously worked as a frontend engineer for Accenture Federal Services building FBI Jobs and Department of Energy websites. Prior to that, I worked at RP3 Agency as a creative technologist prototyping, designing and developing websites and digital experiences. Along side helping companies build software and websites, I occassionally share my knowledge of coding and design through teaching workshops. When I'm not coding I enjoy me producing music and learning Japanese. In 2018, I started an art studio called Digital Anthro where I produce new media art and music.`
